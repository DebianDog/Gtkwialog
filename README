Gtkwialog is a fork of Gtkdialog, which provides alternative
<action> and <input> commandlinestring exec modes.

This bash_default version of gtkwialog always uses bash for
the execution of action and input commandstrings, which allows such 
legacy gtkdialog apps to be run without modification on distributions
that use ash or dash or similar as their system shells. If you want
to force legacy gtkdialog /bin/sh instead, you should start
the gtkwialog applications via environment variable 
GTKWMODE=S mode, as specified below For example, to run pFind,
in legacy /bin/sh mode, start it with:

env GTKWMODE=S pfind

or alternatively, export GTKWMODE=S earlier into the environment.

Naturally, if the main script employs bash functionality (bashisms),
such as export -f functionname, than the script shebang used must be
#!/bin/bash.

With no additional options specified via the environment, commandline
arguments or inline <action> or <input> commands, the default mode
of gtkwialog is 100% drop-in replacement for legacy gtkdialog. That
mode can be changed, in increasing order of precedence, by:

1. setting optional environment variable GTKWMODE=?, where ? can be
   a for glib async non-blocking (internally uses no shell process);
   b for glib sync blocking (internally uses no shell process);
   B to force /bin/bash with modded legacy system calls;
   unset, S, or anything else, means use "default mode", which is 
   drop-in 100% legacy gtkdialog compatible exec mode (i.e. /bin/sh).

2. The environment exec mode can be overwritten by cmdline args:
   -a for glib async non-blocking; -b for glib sync blocking mode.
   No commandline option is provides for B mode (so set GTKWMODE if you
   want that mode for whole dialog). Legacy gtkdialog mode is otherwise
   the default mode anyway.

3. Any action/input exec mode can be overwritten by inline <action> or 
   <input> args:

   -a; -b; -B to uses /bin/bash with modded system calls; -S to use
   legacy /bin/sh mode.

Downloading the Source Code
===========================

Get it from here:
    http://code.google.com/p/gtkdialog/downloads/list

Get the latest revision from SVN (always stable):
    svn checkout http://gtkdialog.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gtkdialog

Get an older revision from SVN:
    svn checkout -r432 http://gtkdialog.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gtkdialog

Compilation and Installation
============================

From a Source Package
---------------------

    ./configure [configure-options]
    make
    make install

From SVN
--------

    ./autogen.sh [configure-options]
    make
    make install

The doc/reference/* and examples/* don't install by default so you might
like to copy them somewhere.

Support for using Glade generated user interfaces is very old and I'd
rather not encourage folk to create Gtkdialog applications in this way.

VTE
---
Gtkdialog's configure script will compile-in support for the Virtual
Terminal Emulator if it finds libvte and its development headers.
libvte source package -> http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/vte/

ARM
---
A problem was encountered when compiling on the ARM platform whereby the
widgets were being packed in the wrong order and I have applied a fix for
this wrapped in an #ifdef __arm__ preprocessor macro in automaton.c.
